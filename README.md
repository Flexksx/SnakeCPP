# SnakeCPP

This implementation of Snake's game may not be the most efficient one logic-wise, you could simply do it using arrays, but I wanted to practice some stuff like OOP and working with dynamic memory allocation so I've done it my way. Since I was writing it on Linux, but I wanted to be able to launch it on Windows too, I've used the C++ preprocessor to include the proper header files.
